## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend. 

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Pre-requisites

* Python virtual environment with Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12

        pip install evo-data-converters-omf
9. The **omf package** will compile and install into your Python environment.

## OMF

Open Mining Format (OMF) is a standard backed by the Global Mining Guidelines Group.

Refer here for more information: https://omf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To work with OMF files the `omf2` module is used, which is a Python interface to the `omf_rust` package:

https://github.com/gmggroup/omf-rust

### Publish geoscience objects from an OMF file
**Note**: For some OMF geometry types there is more than one possible way they could be converted to geoscience objects. For example, an OMF `LineSet` can be used to represent more than one thing (poly-lines, drillholes, a wireframe mesh, etc). In this example they are converted to `LineSegments`. Depending on your use case, you may want to convert them to a different geoscience object.

[The `evo-sdk-common` Python library](https://pypi.org/project/evo-sdk-common/) can be used to sign in. After successfully signing in, the user can select an organisation, an Evo hub, and a workspace. Use [`evo-objects`](https://pypi.org/project/evo-objects/) to get an `ObjectAPIClient`, and [`evo-data-converters-common`](https://pypi.org/project/evo-data-converters-common/) to convert your file.

Choose the OMF file you want to publish and set its path in the `omf_file` variable.
Choose an EPSG code to use for the Coordinate Reference System.

You can also specify tags to add to the created geoscience objects.

Then call `convert_omf`, passing it the OMF file path, EPSG code, the `ObjectAPIClient` from above, and finally a path you want the published objects to appear under in your workspace.

**Note:** Some geometry types are not yet supported. A warning will be shown for each element that could not be converted.

```python
import os
import pprint

from evo.aio import AioTransport
from evo.common import APIConnector
from evo.common.utils import BackoffIncremental
from evo.data_converters.omf.importer import convert_omf
from evo.discovery import DiscoveryAPIClient
from evo.oauth import AuthorizationCodeAuthorizer, OIDCConnector
from evo.objects import ObjectAPIClient
from evo.workspaces import WorkspaceAPIClient

# Configure the transport.
transport = AioTransport(
    user_agent="evo-sdk-common-example",
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff_method=BackoffIncremental(2),
    num_pools=4,
    verify_ssl=True,
)

# Login to the Evo platform.
# User Login
authorizer = AuthorizationCodeAuthorizer(
    redirect_url="<redirect_url>",
    oidc_connector=OIDCConnector(
        transport=transport,
        oidc_issuer="<issuer_url>",
        client_id="<client_id>",
    ),
)
await authorizer.login()

# Select an Organization.
async with APIConnector("https://discover.api.seequent.com", transport, authorizer) as api_connector:
    discovery_client = DiscoveryAPIClient(api_connector)
    organizations = await discovery_client.list_organizations()

selected_org = organizations[0]

# Select a hub and create a connector.
hub_connector = APIConnector(selected_org.hubs[0].url, transport, authorizer)

# Select a Workspace.
async with hub_connector:
    workspace_client = WorkspaceAPIClient(hub_connector, selected_org.id)
    workspaces = await workspace_client.list_workspaces()

workspace = workspaces[0]
workspace_env = workspace.get_environment()

# Convert your object.
async with hub_connector:
    service_client = ObjectAPIClient(workspace_env, hub_connector)
    omf_file = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "data/input/one_of_everything.omf")
    epsg_code = 32650

    tags = {"TagName": "Tag value"}

    objects_metadata = convert_omf(
        filepath=omf_file,
        epsg_code=epsg_code,
        object_service_client=service_client,
        tags=tags,
        upload_path="path/to/my/object"
    )

    print("These objects have now been published:")
    for metadata in objects_metadata:
        pprint.pp(metadata, indent=4)
```

### Export objects to OMF

To export an object from Evo to an OMF file, specify the Evo object UUID of the object you want to export and the output file path, and then call `export_omf()`.
See documentation on the `ObjectAPIClient` for listing objects and getting their IDs and versions.

You may also specify the version of this object to export. If not specified, so it will export the latest version.

You will need the same selection of organisation, Evo hub, and workspace that is needed for importing objects.

**Note**: Some geoscience object types are not yet supported.

```python
import os
from uuid import UUID

from evo.data_converters.common import EvoObjectMetadata
from evo.data_converters.omf.exporter import export_omf

objects = []
objects.append(
    EvoObjectMetadata(
        object_id=UUID("<object_id>"),
        version_id="<version_id>"))

output_dir = "data/output"
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

output_file = f"{output_dir}/object.omf"

export_omf(
    filepath=output_file,
    objects=objects,
    service_client=service_client,
)
```

### Block models

[Block models](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/blockmodel) can be imported using the standard `convert_omf` function.

Block models work a little bit differently for export. These use a `BlockSyncClient` rather than the `ObjectAPIClient` to access models stored in BlockSync. Create a `BlockSyncClient` using the Environment and APIConnector in the same way you would create and `ObjectAPIClient`.

```python
from evo.data_converters.common import BlockSyncClient

blocksync_client = BlockSyncClient(workspace_env, hub_connector)
```

#### Export a block model to OMF V1

Specify the block model UUID of the block model object you want to export and the output file path, then call `export_blocksync_omf()`.

**Note**: At this stage only Regular block model types are supported.

```python
import os
from uuid import UUID

from evo.data_converters.omf.exporter import export_blocksync_omf

object_id = ""
version_id = None

output_dir = "data/output"
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

output_file = f"{output_dir}/{object_id}.omf"

export_blocksync_omf(
    filepath=output_file,
    object_id=UUID(object_id),
    version_id=version_id,
    service_client=blocksync_client,
)

print(f"File saved to {output_file}")
```

### Download Parquet file only

```python
import shutil

import pyarrow.parquet as pq

object_id = ""
dest_file = f"data/output/{object_id}.parquet"

job_url = blocksync_client.get_blockmodel_columns_job_url(object_id)
download_url = blocksync_client.get_blockmodel_columns_download_url(job_url)
downloaded_file = blocksync_client.download_parquet(download_url)

shutil.copy(downloaded_file.name, dest_file)

table = pq.read_table(dest_file)

for column in table.column_names:
    print(f"{column} is of type: {table.schema.field(column).type}")
```
